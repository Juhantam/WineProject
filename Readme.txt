This is our data science project about wine reviews.

All of our code is contained in one Python Notebook file: WineProject.ipynb. The code is divided into different parts, every part has a markdown cell with a title for the following code.
Our code first reads the data in and does some data cleaning. Then follows the part where we conducted statistical analysis on the data and drew many different graphs.
We also have code for encoding the data into numerical form and then using it to develop machine learning algorithms for predicting both points of wines and the price of wines.
Finally, we also did some text analysis on the wine descriptions.

To run our code, it is necessary to open the WineProject.ipynb file with a program that can read Python notebook files, for example we used Jupyter Notebook.
